I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Koo Lab](http://koolab.cshl.edu/) at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, focussing on interpretable machine learning for genomics. Previously, I was a PhD candidate at the [Predictive Science Lab](https://www.predictivesciencelab.org/) at Purdue. My academic and research interests include scientific machine learning, uncertainty quantification, dynamical systems, Bayesian inference and more. In my spare time, I like to read, go for a run, watch football and listen to metal.
